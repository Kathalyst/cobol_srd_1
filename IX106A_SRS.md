# Overview

This COBOL program is a test suite for validating file handling capabilities, specifically for working with three different types of files: sequential, indexed, and relative. Here's a high-level overview of what the program does:

1. It sets up the environment and file definitions for the three file types.

2. It creates a relative file randomly (SECT-0001-RIS101).

3. It creates a sequential and an indexed file using the relative file as input (SECT-0002-RIS101).

4. It tests the ability to have all three different file types opened and used simultaneously (SECT-0003-RIS101).

5. It tests the ability to delete records from one file type while having the other files open (SECT-0004-RIS101).

6. It tests the ability to rewrite a file while other files are being manipulated (SECT-TEST-005-RIS101).

Throughout these sections, the program performs various operations like:
- Opening and closing files
- Reading records
- Writing records
- Deleting records
- Rewriting records

It also includes error checking and reporting functionality to validate that the operations are performed correctly. The program uses a series of test cases to ensure that the COBOL implementation being tested can handle these file operations correctly and efficiently.

This appears to be part of a larger COBOL validation suite, designed to test compliance with COBOL standards and proper implementation of file handling features.

## Data Structures

Based on the COBOL code provided, here is a summary of the key output data structures:

1. Print File (PRINT-FILE)
   - Record layout: 120 character fixed-length records
   - Contains test results and details printed during program execution

2. Relative File (RL-FR1) 
   - Record layout: 241 character fixed-length records
   - Key fields:
     - RL-FR1-KEY: 13 characters 
     - RL-FR1-ALTKEY1: 20 characters
     - RL-FR1-ALTKEY2: 20 characters

3. Indexed File (IX-FS1)
   - Record layout: 241 character fixed-length records  
   - Key fields:
     - IX-FS1-KEY: 13 characters
     - IX-FS1-ALTKEY1: 20 characters 
     - IX-FS1-ALTKEY2: 20 characters

4. Sequential File (SQ-FS1)
   - Record layout: 241 character fixed-length records
   - Key fields:
     - SQ-FS1-KEY: 13 characters
     - SQ-FS1-ALTKEY1: 20 characters
     - SQ-FS1-ALTKEY2: 20 characters

The program performs various operations on these files including:
- Creating and writing records to the relative file
- Reading the relative file and writing records to the indexed and sequential files
- Reading, deleting and rewriting records in all three file types

The output focuses on testing the ability to use all three file types (relative, indexed, sequential) together in one program, including creating, reading, updating and deleting records across the different file types.

## Functionality

This COBOL program is designed to test the functionality of working with three different types of files simultaneously: sequential, indexed, and relative. Here's a breakdown of the main components and functionality:

1. File Definitions:
   - RL-FR1: Relative file
   - IX-FS1: Indexed file
   - SQ-FS1: Sequential file

2. Main Sections:
   - SECT-0001-RIS101: Creates a relative file randomly
   - SECT-0002-RIS101: Creates sequential and indexed files using the relative file as input
   - SECT-0003-RIS101: Tests the ability to have all three file types open and used simultaneously
   - SECT-0004-RIS101: Tests the ability to delete records from one file type while having other files open
   - SECT-TEST-005-RIS101: Tests the ability to rewrite a file while other files are being manipulated

3. Key Functionalities:
   - File creation and initialization
   - Reading and writing records to different file types
   - Deleting records
   - Rewriting records
   - Handling invalid keys and error conditions

4. Testing Procedures:
   - The program performs various operations on the files and checks the results against expected outcomes
   - It uses a series of PERFORM statements to execute test routines
   - Results are reported using PASS, FAIL, and PRINT-DETAIL procedures

5. File Structure:
   - Each file type has a specific record structure defined in the FILE SECTION
   - The program manipulates these records, often copying data between different file types

6. Error Handling:
   - The program includes error counters and invalid key handling for each file type
   - It reports detailed information about failures and unexpected results

Overall, this program is designed to thoroughly test the implementation's ability to handle multiple file types concurrently, ensuring that operations like reading, writing, deleting, and rewriting work correctly across different file organizations. It's likely part of a larger validation suite for COBOL compilers or runtime environments.
