# Overview
This COBOL program is designed to test the ability to use three different types of files (sequential, indexed, and relative) in one program. Here's a high-level overview of what the code does:

1. It's divided into five main sections:

   a. Creates a relative file randomly.
   b. Uses all three file types, reading the relative file and writing out sequential and indexed files.
   c. Further tests the ability to use the three file types.
   d. Tests the ability to delete records from different file types.
   e. Tests the ability to rewrite records to each of the file types.

2. The program defines file structures for relative (RL-FR1), indexed (IX-FS1), and sequential (SQ-FS1) files.

3. It includes various routines for opening, reading, writing, deleting, and rewriting records in these files.

4. The program performs multiple tests, including:
   - Creating and writing to a relative file
   - Reading from the relative file and writing to sequential and indexed files
   - Opening and reading from all three file types simultaneously
   - Deleting records from one file type while having others open
   - Rewriting records in different file types

5. Throughout the program, there are numerous test cases that check if operations are performed correctly, using PASS/FAIL mechanisms to report results.

6. The code includes error handling for invalid key conditions when accessing records.

7. It uses a variety of COBOL features such as REDEFINES clauses, OCCURS clauses, and file status checking.

8. The program is structured with multiple sections and paragraphs, following typical COBOL organization.

This program appears to be part of a validation suite for testing COBOL compiler implementations, specifically focusing on the handling of different file types and file operations in a single program.

## Data Structures
Based on the COBOL code provided, here is a summary of the output data structures:

1. Print File (PRINT-FILE):
   - Record layout: 120 character fixed-length records
   - Contains test results and details printed during program execution

2. Relative File (RL-FR1):
   - Record layout: 241 character fixed-length records
   - Key: RL-KEY (3-digit numeric)
   - Contains:
     - 120 character record data
     - 13 character record key
     - 20 character alternate key 1
     - 20 character alternate key 2

3. Indexed File (IX-FS1):
   - Record layout: 241 character fixed-length records
   - Primary key: IX-FS1-KEY-11-13 (3 characters)
   - Contains:
     - 120 character record data
     - 13 character record key
     - 20 character alternate key 1
     - 20 character alternate key 2

4. Sequential File (SQ-FS1):
   - Record layout: 241 character fixed-length records
   - Contains:
     - 120 character record data
     - 13 character record key
     - 20 character alternate key 1
     - 20 character alternate key 2

The program performs various operations on these files, including:
- Creating and writing records to the relative file
- Reading from the relative file and writing to the indexed and sequential files
- Reading and manipulating records across all three file types
- Deleting records from the relative file
- Rewriting records in all three file types

The output mainly consists of test results written to the print file, showing the success or failure of various file operations and data comparisons performed throughout the program.

## Functionality
This COBOL program is designed to test the functionality of working with three different types of files simultaneously: sequential, indexed, and relative. Here's a breakdown of the main components and functionality:

1. File Definitions:
   - RL-FR1: Relative file
   - IX-FS1: Indexed file
   - SQ-FS1: Sequential file

2. Main Sections:
   - SECT-0001-RIS101: Creates a relative file randomly
   - SECT-0002-RIS101: Creates sequential and indexed files using the relative file as input
   - SECT-0003-RIS101: Tests the ability to have all three file types open and used simultaneously
   - SECT-0004-RIS101: Tests the ability to delete records from one file type while having other files open
   - SECT-TEST-005-RIS101: Tests the ability to rewrite a file while other files are being manipulated

3. Key Functionality:
   - File creation and manipulation for all three file types
   - Reading, writing, and rewriting records
   - Deleting records
   - Testing various file operations with different file types open simultaneously

4. Business Logic:
   - The program creates test data and performs various operations to validate the correct functioning of file handling in COBOL
   - It checks for correct record contents, key values, and file statuses after operations
   - It verifies that operations on one file type don't interfere with others

5. Testing Process:
   - The program uses a series of test cases to verify different aspects of file handling
   - It performs operations and then checks the results against expected outcomes
   - Pass/Fail results are recorded for each test case

6. Reporting:
   - The program generates a report of test results, including pass/fail status and details of any failures

This program is essentially a validation suite for testing the implementation of COBOL file handling, particularly focusing on the ability to work with multiple file types simultaneously and perform various operations on them.

## Step By Step Walkthrough
Here's a step-by-step walkthrough of how this COBOL program works:

1. The program starts with the Identification Division, which identifies the program (IX106A).

2. The Environment Division sets up the configuration and file control information for the program.

3. The Data Division defines the file structures and working storage variables.

4. The Procedure Division contains the main logic of the program, divided into several sections:

   a. CCVS1 Section: This section handles the initialization of the program, opening files, and setting up test routines.

   b. SECT-0001-RIS101 Section: This section creates a relative file randomly.
      - It opens the RL-FR1 file for output.
      - It writes 225 records to the file using a loop.
      - It closes the file.

   c. SECT-0002-RIS101 Section: This section creates a sequential (SQ-FS1) and an indexed file (IX-FS1) using the relative file (RL-FR1) created in the previous section as input.
      - It opens RL-FR1 for input and SQ-FS1 and IX-FS1 for output.
      - It reads records from RL-FR1 and writes them to SQ-FS1 and IX-FS1.
      - It closes all files.

   d. SECT-0003-RIS101 Section: This section tests the ability to have all three different file types opened and used at the same time.
      - It opens all three files for input.
      - It performs various read operations on all three files.
      - It closes all files.

   e. SECT-0004-RIS101 Section: This section tests the ability to delete records from one file type while having the other files open.
      - It opens all three files for I-O.
      - It deletes a record from RL-FR1.
      - It verifies the deletion by re-reading the file.
      - It closes all files.

   f. SECT-TEST-005-RIS101 Section: This section tests the ability to rewrite a file while other files are being manipulated.
      - It opens all three files for I-O.
      - It performs rewrite operations on RL-FR1, SQ-FS1, and IX-FS1 while reading from the other files.
      - It verifies the rewrites by re-reading the files.
      - It closes all files.

5. The program ends with the CCVS-EXIT section, which handles the program termination.

Throughout the program, there are various test routines (like PASS, FAIL, PRINT-DETAIL) that are used to report on the success or failure of different operations.

This program is essentially a test suite for file operations in COBOL, specifically testing the interactions between relative, sequential, and indexed file types.
